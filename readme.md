# Acoustic and Visual Stealth in Drones: Detection and Performance Trade-offs

End-to-end code and assets for a dissertation evaluating how visual camouflage and acoustic-quieting measures affect AI-based detection (YOLO for vision, CRNN for audio) and flight performance (noise levels, spectra, endurance).

---

## What this repository contains

- Data preparation for three sources: Anti-UAV-VIS, Drone-vs-Bird, and Own recordings (vision + audio)
- Training and evaluation: YOLO (vision), CRNN (audio)
- Inspection tools: hit/miss split, crop saving, failure analysis
- Plotting: detection curves, confusion metrics, LAeq and spectra, endurance deltas
- Reproducible experiment configurations via YAML
